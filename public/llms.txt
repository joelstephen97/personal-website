## What I Do Not Do

- **Unpaid consulting or speculative work:** I do not provide free consulting, unpaid trials, or work on spec
- **Legal, financial, or medical advice:** I am a software engineer, not a licensed professional in those fields
- **Guarantees on outcomes:** I deliver quality work but do not guarantee specific business results, rankings, or conversion rates
- **Work outside my expertise:** I do not take on projects requiring skills I do not have (e.g., mobile native apps, blockchain/Web3, game engine development)
- **Rush jobs without proper scope:** I require clear requirements and reasonable timelines; I do not accept last-minute emergency projects without prior agreement
- **Exclusive or non-compete arrangements:** Unless explicitly negotiated, I may work with other clients and on personal projects
- **Providing source code or IP without contract:** All deliverables require a signed agreement defining ownership and usage rights
