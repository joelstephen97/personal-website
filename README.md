# Personal Website Project

For a while I have been wanting to make a personal website utilizing the cutting edge flexibity of VueJs and Nuxt
So I decided to embark on this project to apply all my knowledge and build something. 

> It had to be [Vue] and using [Nuxt] as this was the stack I was most familiar with.

> Hosted on Vercel through Github seemed like the logical straightforward deployment option.

> And using the magic of tailwind.
